ooh watching wild skies wishing with closed eyes ooh run for a lifetime follow the signs i put my pictures down they're not as good as the real thing i wish i could go home you're just nostalgic what do we wander from and only notice it now so be here with me and i watched the water unfold it's a feeling i want you to know cause i'm not the same as i was as i shoulder the weight of the world i was setting in stone until i noticed it right do you see how you've grown don't be sorry then and i fall from my bones and now i know i'm alive i want you to find it you might also like and i watched the water unfold it's a feeling i want you to know causе i'm not the same as i was as i shoulder thе weight of the world thaw your hands now  i have been numb put color in your cheeks  where i belong i missed you back then so be here with me and i watched the water unfold it's a feeling i want you to know and i watched the water unfold it's a feeling i want you to know cause i'm not the same as i was as i shoulder the weight of the world  cause i'm not the same as i was as i shoulder the weight of the world and i watched the water unfold it's a feeling i want you to know cause i'm not the same as i was as i shoulder the weight of the world
