1-bonefish bonefish a peacebone got found in the dinosaur wing well i've been jumpin all over but my views were slowly shrinking i was a jugular vein in a juggler’s girl i was supposedly leaking the most interesting colors while half of my fingers are dipped in the sand you progress in letters but you're used to cooking broccoli the other side of takeout is mildew on rice and an obsession with the past is like a dead fly and just a few things are related to the old times then we did believe in magic and we did die it's not my words that you should follow it's your insides you're just an inside adjust your insides you're just an inside  bonefish i bet the monster was happy when we made him a maze cause he don’t understand intentions and he just looks at your face  bonefish i bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bath and all the birds are very curious all the fish were at the surface you might also like with half of me waiting for myself to get calm i'm like a pelican at red tide i'm a corpse i'm not a fisherman and a blow out does not mean i will have a good night and an obsession with the past is like a dead fly and just a few things are related to the old times then we did believe in magic and we did die it's not my words that you should follow it's your insides you're just an inside adjust your insides you're just an inside  bonefish bonefish well i start in a hose and i'll end in a yard when i feel like i'm stealing i can't keep myself from hearing god only the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the ground it was the clouds that carved the mountains  bonefish it was the mountains that made the kids scream oh well she bore all her parts but she never was found you think i'll carve a path through new york to be an artist but are you anything you find out that you can’t ask a baby to cry and an obsession with the past is like a dead fly and just a few things are related to the old times when we did believe in magic and we did die it's not my words that you should follow it's your inside adjust your insides you're just an inside inside inside inside inside inside inside inside peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone  bonefish peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone peacebone bonefish
