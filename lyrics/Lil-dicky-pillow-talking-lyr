army and navy what if tomorrow is the day that the fuckin aliens came and invaded our nation like would we even be able to fuck with their shit like do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships or not at all like would they just walk up in this motherfucker laughin at us and blastin at us and makin everybody disintegrate and assimilate without a hint of intimidation or could we do some

universe always expandin  ayy there are infinite galaxies  infinite why would we be the anomaly she like  that's no coincidence  uh i call that shit god  hold up i'm like  oh you're religious bitch you think it's all god  no i know it's all god no i know that there might be a god first off nobody knows there's a god girl i think we should drop this  ayy no what's goin on in your brain right now

fuck who gettin money that's brain  brain who make decisions that's brain  that's brain uh who make the hits that been brain  oh that brain who run this whole operation that been brain since— brain can— can you just get back to the issue here uh  really can you just remind the brain heh you're such an idiot we're talking about god and if he exists don't call brain names mm the brain couldn't recall hm but if i'm not mistaken this bitch to my left guaranteed there's a god i believe in a god yes  so god never wrong god never wrong right heh yeah that's like the whole point brain just get there please hold up so god made the earth  ayy and god was like  hold up  hold up this shit is borin it need more shit god was like  i'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch  ayy dinosaurs on that bitch then he like  why'd i put dinosaurs on that shit what is your brain even saying can he get to the point hold up brain you just did it  ah god ain't wrong what the fuck was he thinking  about what bitch the dinosaurs he made the earth for them and then he like  nah dinosaurs are just blah  what's your point i'ma cook up some blondes like he was way off i don't look like a dinosaur ho them things thirty-five feet i'm like five-foot-eleven  up on tinder i'm six-foot ayy seen the bronchiosaurus that thing fuckin neck go to heaven  good shit brain and that's just an expression bitch there ain't no heaven  ayy  funny i'm just messin but if he ain't wrong i guess this the exception can i talk now  go ahead  look everything in life has purpose  ayy you chickens a midget at a circus what  i don't interpret  ayy she like  that's not for me to determine so dinosaurs purpose was to just die that's not for me to determine but– okay i'm just a person okay but think of the root of the argument girl  ayy view how we started this girl like you don't believe in the aliens  yeah i just"— you confine god to earth girl i find that shit salient i just don't presume to know the plan bitch me neither but that's not what i've been sayin well what are you saying why can't god fuck with aliens why can't earth be like a fuckin small side project for this guy okay look we just don't see eye to eye yeah but- agh logically like you don't believe in your side well you're bringin up the fuckin dinosaurs like we could have- shared the earth with them nobody knows yeah there is hard soil evidence girl like what's next you don't fuck with pangaea she like  let's change the subject  okay this bitch don't know bout pangaea brain leave it alone  mm  uh i'm starving are you hungry by chance  oh my

against us being gluttonous thinkin that animals live on this earth to get eat okay is it how we treat them heh that sure doesn't help  okay she like  i'm not opposed to us huntin  ayy but now we not trackin them down we just breed em to eat that's disgustin  ayy you should honestly read on the subject  all right hold up  hold up just because we not runnin round with a bow and arrow doesn't mean we not huntin these chickens  ayy we just set the place to do our huntin intelligently enough to manipulate these animals and get em to do exactly what we want that's my point we just incubate animals instead of just lettin em live how they come yeah but- that's your god at work bitch while we go hard on earth what you think would happen right now if you left my place and there were like three wolves waitin for you  wolves bitch they would tear your ass up viciously like they would eat your titties  and your pussy that's what they do  and your face and shit ayy humans are smarter bitch
