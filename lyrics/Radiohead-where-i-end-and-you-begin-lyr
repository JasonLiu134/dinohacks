there's a gap in between there's a gap where we meet where i end and you begin and i'm sorry for us the dinosaurs roam the earth the sky turns green where i end and you begin four five six seven i am up in the clouds i am up in the clouds and i can't and i can't come down i can watch but not take part where i end and where you start where you you left me alone you left me alone x will mark the place like the parting of the waves like a house falling in the sea in the sea you might also like i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies there'll be no more lies i will eat you alive i will eat you alive i will eat you alive
