here we stand like an adam and eve waterfalls garden of eden two fools in love so beautiful and strong birds in the trees are smiling upon them from the age of the dinosaurs cars have run on gasoline where where have they gone now it's nothing but flowers there was a factory now there are mountains and rivers you've got it you've got it we caught a rattlesnake now we've got something for dinner you've got it you've got it there was a shopping mall now it's all covered with flowers you've got it you've got it you might also like if this is paradise i wish i had a lawn mower you've got it you've got it years ago i was an angry young man i'd pretend that i was a billboard standing tall by the side of the road i fell in love with the beautiful highway this used to be real estate now it's only fields and trees where where is the town now it's nothing but flowers the highways and cars were sacrificed for agriculture i thought that we'd start over but i guess i was wrong once there were parking lots now it's a peaceful oasis you've got it you've got it this was a pizza hut now it's all covered with daisies you've got it you've got it i miss the honky tonks dairy queens and - elevens you've got it you've got it and as things fell apart nobody paid much attention you've got it you've got it i dream of cherry pies candy bars and chocolate chip cookies you've got it you've got it we used to microwave now we just eat nuts and berries you've got it you've got it this was a discount store now it's turned into a cornfield you've got it you've got it don't leave me stranded here i can't get used to this lifestyle
