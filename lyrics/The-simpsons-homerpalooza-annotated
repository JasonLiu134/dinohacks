wow you know most of my life i've i've had to live with the shame of being a screw-up but now as i stand here with the award for the district's safest bus driver well it it's like a dream come true  otto wake up otto's head lurches up he has been sleeping at the wheel again proving that it definitely was a dream otto is forced into a series of driving moves reminiscent of g t a narrowly avoiding jasper he ends up in the auto wrecking yard as the kids flee the bus is slowly crushed into a smaller and smaller cube which is then ejected and is left as a smoking cube at the children's feet   so um who's good at keeping secrets as she reads her voice becomes more skeptical and cross eventually taking what has become her nagging tone dear parents due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks by reading this letter out loud you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity throughout the universe well we'll have to organize a car pool hey every day will be like a road trip with your dad to school bart and lisa: the next morning homer is driving bart lisa milhouse nelson and janey in typical parent fashion he insists on talking to the kids despitethe awkward situation he is creating so how about those rainbow suspenders huh dad pretty cool way to keep your pants up eh : dad i see these

homer begins smiling contently nodding his head to the strains of a band that the children clearly find terrible nelson looking awkward begins to punch milhouse in the shoulder nelson:  tell him milhouse:  mr simpson sir can you please change the radio station homer looks round a small amount of shock and surprise on his face homer:  but this is grand funk railroad you kids know grand funk right as the kids look embarrassed at not knowing the band homer begins to look fearfully into the distance homer:  nobody knows the band grand funk the wild shirtless lyrics of mark farner the bong rattling bass of mel schacher the competent drum work of don brewer oh man the car pulls to a screeching halt outside the school and the kids sprint off even work shy kids like nelson and bart presumably to get away from homer homer,not to be outdone leans out of his car window and shouts homer:  for more information on grand funk consult your local library homer who seems to dominate the car pool rota is taking the kids to school the song playing in the background is mississippi queen by mountain as homer enthusiastically nods his head telling the kids how to headbang homer:  when i listen to a really good song i start nodding my head like i'm saying yes to every beat y e s y e s y e s this rocks and then sometimes i switch it up like n o n o n o don't stop rocking bart:  dad please you're embarrassing us homer:  no i'm not i'm teaching you about rock music now grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane which cleared the way for jefferson starship the stage

it's a scientific fact flashback to the aforementioned year where a group of people are installing a strobe light in a custom van of theirs: jock:  quadraphonic sound a waterbed and now a strobe light gentlemen say hello to the second-base mobile when they resume dancing on  frankenstein with the lights flashing homer sneaks up and hovers  before giving up and retreating homer  :  back then we

which to get funky homer:  i've gotta get out of this rut and back into the groove marge:  well good try to include bart and lisa the next morning bart and lisa are prepared to enter a dangerous pact to prevent further upset bart: dear lord if you keep homer from embarrassing us today wepromise to build several churches in your honor lisa: bart no homer still roped into the car duty it seems guns it past milhouse leaving him chasing the car down the road milhouse:  hey wait i'm okay today my mom bought me deodorant lisa:  dad you forgot to pick up milhouse homer in a vain attempt at sarcasm that is made even funnier by his comically enlarged eyes as this was the nineties he probably intended to finish with some form or  not joke or an even funnier psyche homer:  i did  i must be getting forgetful in my old age open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine lisa:  what are you talking about  homer keeps pointing at the glove compartment lisa opens it and several tickets fall out homer:  well what have we here looks like your uncool dad scoredtickets to hullabalooza lisa:  bart these look real bart:  check the authenticator spot lisa removes a sticker which reveals a

handover his homemade kahlúa security guard:  people have your have your tickets out,throw your cameras out,surrender all identification homer:  ohh my homemade kahlúa the simpsons begin to wander through the crowd passing various stalls and shops lisa: generation x may be shallow but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people homer: hey: a freak show the freak show consists of a bearded lady a man with hundreds of cigarettes in his mouth,a man nailing a large spike into his face and two pink poodles the man nailing his face whacks his thumb and then complaining bitterly introduces the act coming onto the stage preformer:  thankyou thankyou very much and now the band you have all been waiting for cypress hill cypress hill come charging onto the stage but before they perform they have an important message to relay b- real: before we start we have a lost child here if she's not claimed within the next hour she will become property of blockbuster entertainment as cypress hill begin to preform throw your set in the air bart and lisa notice something smells weird bart:  what is that smell lisa:  it smells like otto's jacket homer oblivious to what is going on is off buying a rasta hat and a badge after his purchase the clerk begins to point at the  tips box clerk: dude karma homer: what clerk: karma karma homer blankly stares at the man before walking away homer: oh i get it homer walks to over to rejoin bart and lisa proudly sporting his new hat bart: dad you cannot wear that that's a rastafarian hat homer: pft hey i've been safariing since before you

sticker on his controversial headpiece bart: you know what dad maybe we'll go exploring on our own for awhile left alone homer decides to regain his place with the cool people homer:  well homer this

homer:  more butt support,more butt support homer is thrown to the ground behind the crowd meanwhile bart and lisa are dancing and listening to the festival the smashing pumpkins are playing and the crowd is swaying in a zombie like manner lisa: it may be bleak but this music is really getting to the crowd bart: eh making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel homer walks away sulking and muttering to himself homer it makes no sense i haven't changed since high school and suddenly i'm uncool uh i been kicked out of paradise homer starts watching the teamsters unload the trucks and he is depressed when he sees how cool they are homer:  i'll never be part of the scene again homer punts a small cannon in a fit of rage it starts to fizz and spark malfunctioning homer backs away looking terrified homer:  uh-oh an object shoots out of the cannon and slams homer in the gut as he doubles over in pain the object inflates and turns into a giant saloon pig teamster: aw man there goes peter frampton's big finale he's gonna be pissed off frampton: you're damn right i'm going to be pissed off; i bought thatpig at pink floyd's yard sale as the crowd surrounds homer bart and lisa run over to comfort him lisa:  dad,dad are you ok homer:  i'm....fine the crowd begins to mutter and point amazed at homers resilience the manager moves over shaking homer firmly by the hand manager: sir i run hullabalooza's pageant of the transmundane -- the freak show -- and i've been looking for a big fatso to shoot with a cannon i'd like very much for you to be that fatso homer stands there with an awestruck look on his face as hallelujah music plays in the background homer tells marge but she does not see eye to eye with him on this marge: so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show homer: i don't think i have a choice marge marge: of course you have a choice homer: how do you figure marge: you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along homer: you know marge in some ways you and i are very differentpeople homer dense as usual does not listen to marge he is now naked down to the waist hiding behind a sheet in the background a large crowd can be seen homer has joined the freakshow and he is preparing for his first act manager:  and now get ready for the man with the iron stomach homer walks on stage and nervously addresses the audience homer:  hi everybody is everybody good the orderlies wheel the giant cannon onto the stage homer in the interests of safety applies his lab goggles and braces for the impact the cannon fires and hits him square in the gut to the cheers of the audience he seems unharmed and rises to his feet homer:  thankyou...thank you very much a little person walks on stage and takes homer by the hand and leads him off stage homer is then signing autographs for his loyal fans he is signing a bowling ball with the text stay in school yourhero homer homer hands the ball to the punter who is revealed to be a small child who is predictably crushed by the heavy ball billy corgan:  hey cannonball i like your statement: when life takes a cheap shot at you you stand your ground billy corgan

person i admire most and has chosen homer as his subject homer seems genuinely touched and smiles to himself as the two of them share the pie homer's stomach begins to rumble reminding him of his fate
