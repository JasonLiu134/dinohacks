i don’t know what was wrong but i wasn’t as strong i’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them but if this was a dream i still know that i’ve seen fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them i’m so far from perfect you still loved me when i so far from deserved it if i’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage i hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor all of us all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms the good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war the missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar i shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core i can’t imagine that i’ll ever be happy like before before before we’re sitting in a field in golden gate park off fulton and th and i’ve never felt less alone just a block from the home i’ve outgrown five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed an inch above this casserole of stones grass and mud rusty needles lost guitar picks indian tombs and dinosaur bones everything happened all at once and the world is spinning like a hubcap and not just because of the drugs we hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind we had the rest of our lives to be dry so we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light i would have stayed until our hair turned white the mosquitoes arrived to feast on time got drunk at our expense we didn’t mind we let them bite we kept on kissing and obliged say “bottoms up you’ve only got til tuesday so enjoy the ride!” and i couldn’t imagine that i would ever be unhappy again and i whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem that i just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites decided i’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle perfect and pink in permanent ink the beautiful wounds that will keep me you and this moment forever linked to remind me when i fail myself when i fail everyone around me when i misfire and come tearing through your walls when the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins and this carnival of carnage this mansion of garbage this parking lot of carcasses this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains that i have been a part of something worthwhile to remind me of the pleasure of your pulse the measure of your breath the rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests these spectacular triumphs and flops that even if that moment meant nothing to the universe it’s the closest thing to god i’ve got i’m so far from perfect so far it’s been worth it you might also like but if this was a dream i still know that i've seen fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them i don’t know what was wrong but i wasn’t as strong i’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them but if this was a dream i still know that i’ve seen fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them but if this was a dream i still know that i've seen fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them
