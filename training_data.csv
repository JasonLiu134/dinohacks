1,1,crouched down by the tree at his neighbors he liked the way the bark ripped off like paper he pretended he was superman eyes had lasers every step he took turned earth into craters little brown jacket lee jeans with a cuff bowl cut blue and yellow mismatched chucks he's a sitting duck didn't hear the car pull up thought his arm broke when they shoved him in the trunk brake light night light choking on his tear snot fear not summarize the voice within an earshot muffled through the seats stale smoke he can hear scott- heron singing  home is where the hatred is home is where they took him from and he don't know who's taken him puffy eyes pissed pants sore throat scream like a whisper fists beat the backseat every time he whimpers he can see his own breath it's the middle of the winter x- men hologram card that was in his coat a single source of hope as they speedin up the road he traded comics for it he got a sleeve for its protection he's just glad he got it with him it's his one possession he miss his mom's affection he miss the dinosaur blanket on the bed that he slept in miss throwing sticks so the dog would go fetch em missed makin forts in the woods with his best friend you might also like car stops door slams wonders who he is he just doesn't understand chafed legs denim tears piss vomit wishing he could change into his blue pajamas superman logo with a cape on it then maybe he'd escape into space like a comet he hears an engine's sputter fatigued from the travel he listens as footsteps grind in the gravel maybe he can leave if he promise not to tattle the trunk wasn't eden but he knew he was the apple streetlights flooded as the trunk popped open hoping for a relief or a reason he was chosen lurking was a silhouette with unfamiliar hands now he's a shaking mess carried cause he couldn't stand bluish glow of television flickers in a stairwell led into a lair he got sick from how the air smells he's with his parents in his brain this is their hell he felt the worry in his bones he don't fare well against these monsters in this crypt in this hidden jail all this time passed i'm still scared that i'm there still all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember was there a life before the one i know now was i lost and just never ever found was i found and then forced to forget just a secret that nobody can admit was there a life before the one i know now was i lost and just never ever found was i found and then forced to forget just a secret that nobody can admit all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember all these fucking years i just don't remember all this fucking time i just don't remember did i lose my mind i just don't remember did i die am i lying i just don't remember all these fucking years i just don't remember
